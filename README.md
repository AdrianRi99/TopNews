# üí° About the Project
TopNews is an alternative to traditional news apps that often overwhelm users with excessive or irrelevant content. This app aims to provide a minimalist approach by displaying only the 5 most important news of the day per category. With a focus on clarity and brevity, TopNews helps users stay informed without the noise of unnecessary information.

The current repository represents an initial structure and attempt to build such an application. News data is fetched from NewsAPI, a popular service for obtaining the latest news articles.

To improve the app‚Äôs usability, further enhancements to the data sources and content filtering are required to ensure the news is highly relevant and engaging.
